# campus-reservation-system
Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the campus has been limiting student involvement, specifically the number of students at each location across campus. We'd like to develop a system that makes it easier for students to view which locations are open at which times; such a system would allow them to create reservations for these locations and, by extension, limit their interaction with other individuals. And also provide an interface to view statistics on building activity and reccommend the best time to make a reservation given past data in our database.
